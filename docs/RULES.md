# Project Rules — Hyperliquid Trading Bot

## Rule #1: Commit AND Push to Main
Every time you modify **any file** in this repository, you must complete the full cycle:

1. `git add` the files you just touched.
2. `git commit` with a meaningful message.
3. `git push origin main` so the change lands on the remote immediately.

Committing locally is NOT enough—changes must be pushed to the remote repository right away. This is your checkpoint and the most important rule for maintaining project integrity, tracking progress, and ensuring your work is backed up and accessible.

## Rule #2: Take Time to Understand How It All Fits Together
Before making changes or adding features, take the time to understand how the code, modules, and trading logic connect. This avoids mistakes and ensures smooth development.

## Rule #3: Always Run Your Checks Before Committing and Deploying
Test and validate your changes before committing and deploying. Always run your checks to ensure trading logic, risk controls, and integrations work as intended.

## Rule #4: Break Tasks Into Small Steps
Divide work into small, manageable tasks. This makes it easier to commit frequently, test changes, and maintain high code quality.

## Rule #5: Don't make assumptions
Never assume anything about the codebase, market conditions, or trading logic. Always verify and validate your understanding before making changes.

## Rule #6: Prioritize Safety and Reliability
When making changes, prioritize the safety and reliability of the trading bot. Avoid risky modifications that could lead to significant losses or system failures.

## Rule #7: Document Your Changes
Whenever you make changes, update documentation to reflect the new state of the codebase. This includes README files, CHANGELOG, inline comments, and any relevant design documents.
